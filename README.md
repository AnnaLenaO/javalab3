have ben used for this javalab3

Inspiration for how to structure the code in Warehouse comes from
"Using Records in a Real Use Case" at https://dev.java/learn/records/

The aim is immutability for public methods in Waerhouse,
using functional programming with Streams &
working with parameterized Tests & MethodSource. And no mocking with
Mockito.

In some cases it would have been both easier, more straight forward &
more efficient to create each task in javalab3 from one stream.
It has though been educative to work with the setup made now.
Further improvements could include handling exceptions, test those &
more edge cases. It would also be better if the test providers could be
refactored for less code in WarehouseTest.
